# Vite + Tailwind CSS Boilerplate

This project is a boilerplate that uses Vite and Tailwind CSS to create fast and modern web applications. It provides an optimized initial configuration for an efficient development workflow.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

## Key Features

- **Vite:** An extremely fast and lightweight frontend build tool that greatly improves the development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows you to quickly build custom user interfaces.
- **Simplified Configuration:** Predefined configuration for a quick and easy start.
- **Organized Project Structure:** A clear and maintainable folder structure.
- **Fast Development:** Instant browser reload during development.
- **Production Optimization:** Optimized builds for deployment.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

**Node.js:** (version 20 or higher recommended)
- Download from: nodejs.org

## Quick Start
Follow these steps to start working on the project:
**1. Clone the Repository:**
```sh
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
Replace <REPOSITORY_URL> with the actual URL of your repository.
```
**2. Navigate to the Project Directory:**
```sh
cd <DIRECTORY_NAME>
Replace <DIRECTORY_NAME> with the name of the directory that was created when cloning the repository.
```
**3. Install Dependencies:**
```sh
npm install
```
This command will install all the necessary dependencies defined in `package.json`.

## Development
To start the development server, run the following command:
```sh
npm run dev
```
This will start the server at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port configured in `vite.config.js`). The browser will open automatically (or you can open it manually) to display your application. Changes you make to the `src` files will be instantly reflected in the browser thanks to Vite's hot reload.

## Production Build
To build the project for production, use the following command:
```sh
npm run build
```
This command will create a `dist` folder in the project root. This folder will contain the optimized files for deployment.

## Preview Production Version
To preview the production version locally, run:
```sh
npm run preview
This command will start a local server that serves the files in the dist folder.
```

## Essential Commands
- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the project for production.
- `npm run preview`: Locally previews the production version.
